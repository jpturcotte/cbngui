# GUI Framework Research Plan for Cataclysm-BN Integration

## Research Objectives
Research and analyze the most suitable GUI frameworks for Cataclysm-BN integration, focusing on:
1. SDL2-based solutions that integrate well with existing codebase
2. Raylib for lightweight GUI development
3. CEGUI or other immediate-mode GUI libraries
4. Cross-platform considerations and performance implications
5. Memory usage and rendering efficiency for real-time game overlay

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Baseline Knowledge and Framework Discovery
- [x] 1.1 Research Cataclysm-BN's current technical architecture and GUI requirements
